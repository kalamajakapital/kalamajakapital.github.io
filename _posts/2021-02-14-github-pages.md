At the end of 2020, I ran the numbers, and realised I wouldn't be able to meet my investment goals. Short on money, I decided I'd invest my time in the business I started out of necessity back in 2018.

This is me, taking small steps, building a business that's essentially my pension plan.

Short on money, invest your time and attention.

## So far...

### This year
- Made sure I had a debit card for my business.
- Used my debit card to start a TransferWise account; for cheap currency exchange once I need it.
- Made sure I had a working email, hello Google Workspace! I'm not going to host my own email servers, no way...
- Github and Twitter
- Write code...

### Today
Move [domain](https://www.kalamajakapital.ee) over to Github Pages, not to have to worry about reliability and uptime while hosting stuff on infra I casually change and destroy.

Still shy on taking on expenses for my company, but domain was a necessity once I started, and today, email is something I must have...
