At the end of 2020, I ran the numbers, and realised I wouldn't be able to meet my investment goals. Short on money, I decided I'd invest my time in the business I started out of necessity back in 2018.

This is me, taking small steps, building a business that's essentially my pension plan.

Short on money, invest your time and attention.
